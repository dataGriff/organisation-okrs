# Objective: Improve reliability and performance of core APIs

- KR1: Reduce p95 latency from 420ms → 250ms.
- KR2: Cut weekly incident count from 7 → 2.
- KR3: ≥ 95% SLO compliance for 12 consecutive weeks.
- KR4: Migrate 80% of services to v2 observability stack.

## Risks
- Legacy services lack owners; migration may slip.
- Incident taxonomy incomplete; could mask recurrence.

## Notes
- Latency currently 290–320ms p95 after cache tuning (week 6).
