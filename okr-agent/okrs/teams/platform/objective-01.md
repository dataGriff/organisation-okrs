# Objective

Improve reliability and performance of core APIs

## Key Results

- Reduce p95 latency from 420ms → 250ms.
- Cut weekly incident count from 7 → 2.
- ≥ 95% SLO compliance for 12 consecutive weeks.
- Migrate 80% of services to v2 observability stack.

## Risks

- Legacy services lack owners; migration may slip.
- Incident taxonomy incomplete; could mask recurrence.

## Notes

- Latency currently 290–320ms p95 after cache tuning (week 6).
